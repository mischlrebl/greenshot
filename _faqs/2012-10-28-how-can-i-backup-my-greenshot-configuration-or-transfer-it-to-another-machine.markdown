title: How can I backup my Greenshot configuration? Or transfer it to another machine?
tags: []
---
Greenshot's configuration is stored within a single file called `greenshot.ini`. You can either find it in the program directory (if you are using the ZIP distribution) or in Greenshot's AppData directory (if you used the installer), which is located in your user profile's directory (e.g. in Windows 7, 8 and 10 it is something like `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Greenshot`).

If you want to backup your configuration, simply copy the `greenshot.ini` file to another place. You can even transfer your configuration to a Greenshot installation on another machine, simply copy the file over to the target installation. Just make sure that Greenshot is not running while doing so.
